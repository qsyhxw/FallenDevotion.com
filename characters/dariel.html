                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-purple-600">First Impressions</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Based on the available demo content, Dariel presents as a character whose personality unfolds gradually through player interactions. Community observations from early players suggest a complex individual whose traits become more apparent as the story progresses.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Players who have experienced the demo describe Dariel's character as multifaceted, with layers that reward careful attention to dialogue choices and narrative context. The full depth of Dariel's personality will likely be revealed through the complete route in the final game release.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-purple-600">Character Depth</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Without venturing into spoiler territory, Dariel's role in the overarching narrative appears to connect with the game's philosophical themes. The relationship dynamics with other characters, including the protagonist, remain deliberately mysterious in the demo, setting up intrigue for the full release.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    As with other characters in <em>Fallen Devotion</em>, Dariel's characterization likely draws from the game's exploration of Nietzschean philosophy and psychological complexity, though specific thematic connections will become clearer in the complete version.

                    Dariel appears in the currently available demo version of <em>Fallen Devotion</em>, allowing players to experience initial interactions with the character. The demo provides a foundation for understanding Dariel's role, though the full route with branching paths and multiple endings will be available in the complete game release.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Players can interact with Dariel through dialogue choices and narrative decisions in the demo, though the extent of these interactions is naturally limited compared to what the full version will offer.
